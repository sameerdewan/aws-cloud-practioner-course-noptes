# AWS Regions

* **AWS Regions** are geographic areas that host two or more **Availability Zones** (AZs)
* AWS Regions are the organizing level for AWS services
* When deploying resources, we pick the region where those resources are located
* When doing this, it is important to consider which **region will help optimize latency while minimizing costs, and adhering to regulatory requirements**
* *Resources can be deployed in multiple regions* to better support business needs
* Regions are completely different entities from one another
* Resources in one region are not automatically replicated to resources in another region
* Not all services are available in all regions

To see what services are available in what region, go to [AWS Global Infrastructure](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure)
