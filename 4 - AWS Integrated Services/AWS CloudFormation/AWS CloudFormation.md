# AWS CloudFormation

* **AWS CloudFormation** *simplifies* the task of *repeatedly* and *predictably* *creating groups of related resources* that power your applications
* CloudFormation is about *automating resource provisioning*
* We use the AWS APIs to provision AWS resources
  * **AWS Management Console**
  * **AWS CLI**
  * **AWS CDK/API**
* Using one of the above methods, we create **VPCs**, **EC2 instances**, etc.
* We can *automate* this process for provisioning these resources
* AWS CloudFormation is a fully managed service that can create, update, and delete resources in sets known as **stacks**
* **Template Files** are needed and are read by AWS CloudFormation
* Template Files are instructions that AWS CloudFormation uses to generate a stack
* To control CloudFormation we can use one of our three APIs, or build scripts to automate these actions
* **AWS CloudFormation Stacks**
  * Resources Generated by a template i.e. DynamoDB, Amazon S3 bucket, VPC, EC2 instance
  * Unit of deployment
    * Create stack
    * Update stack
    * Delete stack -> by default, all resources are deleted in the stack
      * *Most companies modularize stacks for networking, security and applications*
* **AWS CloudFormation Templates** (Template File)
  * Resources to provision
  * Text file
  * JSON or YAML format
  * *Acts as a self-documenting environment*
* The same information we'd use in the console is specified in templates instead
* We can use the *dependsOn* attribute to order creation of resources
* **The same template can be used to create different environments, making them more flexible and functional**
  * i.e. Development and Production environments
* **Infrastructure as Code**
  * Can version control templates
* Requirements for CloudFormation
  * Templates
  * Permissions to all services referenced in the template
