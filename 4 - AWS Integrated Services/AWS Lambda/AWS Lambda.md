# AWS Lambda

* **AWS Lambda** *is an event-driven, server-less compute service*
* AWS Lambda is *a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers*
* Only runs code when needed and scales automatically to thousands of requests per second

> **Key Benefits**
>
> * You only pay for the compute you use
> * You don't pay for compute time when the code is not running
> * Ideal for variable and intermittent workloads
> * Run code for virtually any application or backend service with zero administration
> * Highly available compute infrastructure that provides all  administration including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and auto scaling, code monitoring and logging
> * Supports a variety of languages such as Node.js, Java, C#, and Python
> * Run code in response to events like changes to an **Amazon S3** bucket
> * Run code in response to events like a change in an **Amazon DynamoDB** table
> * Respond to HTTP requests using **Amazon API Gateway**
> * Invoke code using API calls made using the **AWS SDK**
> * Build serverless applications triggered by AWS Lambda functions that can be automatically deployed using **AWS Code Pipeline** and **AWS Code Deploy**

> **Use Cases**
>
> * Run code for any application or backend service
> * Automated backups
> * Processing objects uploaded to **Amazon S3**
> * Event driven log analysis
> * Event driven transformations
> * Internet of Things
> * Operating serverless websites
