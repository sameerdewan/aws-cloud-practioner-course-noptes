# Introduction to the AWS Cloud

> **Cloud Computing**: On demand delivery of IT resources and applications over the Internet

* Before *cloud computing*, data centers were made based on guessing maximum peaks.
* *Too little* resources would result in Customers suffering
* *Too much* resources would result in overpaying for unneeded resources
* To solve this, we can use AWS Cloud to access a data center via the Internet that scales up and down with our needs
* We no longer need a fixed and finite infrastructure
* AWS Cloud services reduce risk while scaling computing resources, securing data, and offering disaster protection via redundancy
* For companies, there is a reduced *cost of change*, the ability to *respond quickly*, and be *elastic*
* Services offered by AWS can be used as building blocks
* Resources can be created and managed via: *Amazon Management Console*, *Amazon CLI*, and *Amazon SDKs*
* The ability and power to scaling computing resources up or down easily is known as *elasticity*
